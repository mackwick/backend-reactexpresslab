  "bio": "Mackenzie graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive in May 2024 and immediately joined Pinterest as an apprentice engineer. During her six months in the program, she refined her skills in JavaScript, React, and various styling libraries before accepting a full-time role as a junior full-stack developer with Pinterest. She makes gobs of money and enjoys her work, but also has plenty of flexibility in her schedule to spend time on hobbies and with the people and dogs she loves."
